What is you site's primary purpose?

This site is used to add work I've done so far and possibly in the future of EDA.

Who is your target audience?

Most likely other people in EDA.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want visitors to be able to interact with my site with ease; finding what they need quickly and being able to read each part of the site. Along with this I want the website to be aesthetically pleasing.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

Making sure all the elements in my site are set in a strategic and logical way. For example making headings bigger than paragraphs, having a clear banner, making sure links are obviously links etc.
